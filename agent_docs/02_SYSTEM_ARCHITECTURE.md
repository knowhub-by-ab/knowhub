# KnowHub

## System Architecture Specification

Version: 1.0

Status: Approved Baseline

Depends On:

```text
01_PRD.md
```

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the complete system architecture of KnowHub.

It serves as the technical blueprint for:

* Claude Code
* GitHub Copilot Agent
* Codex
* Amazon Q Developer
* Cursor Agents
* Windsurf Agents
* Roo Code
* Cline
* OpenHands
* Human Developers

---

# 2. Architecture Principles

## 2.1 User Ownership

The user's GitHub repository is the source of truth for learning content.

KnowHub is merely an interface layer.

---

## 2.2 AI As Contributor

AI proposes changes.

AI never silently modifies repositories.

All AI changes pass through:

```text
Draft Workspace
↓
Approval Queue
↓
Commit
↓
Push
```

---

## 2.3 Modular Design

Every subsystem must be independently replaceable.

Examples:

```text
AI Provider
Authentication
Search Engine
Database
Diagram Engine
```

---

## 2.4 Free-Tier First

Architecture must prioritize:

* Free services
* Open-source software
* Self-hostable components

---
